# Crafting Interpreters

This book is part provided material for the class COMP3000: Programming Languages, which I am undertaking at Macquarie University. This repo serves to contain my implementations of the interpreted languages described in the book, and any of the programming challenges outlined throughout.


The book is avaliable to read for free on Nystrom's [website](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
